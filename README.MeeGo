These are instructions for compiling Calligra's libraries for MeeGo using
the tiny profile, and with only words, tables and kpresenter enabled, with
no docs built, and the mobile version turned off.

This is what is needed for the intel project's codebase, the compilation of
which is described afterwards.

=================================================
calligra:

cmake options:
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DTINY=on -DBUILD_doc=off -DBUILD_mobile=off -DGHNS=off

Install the following packages:
 git kde-mobile-devel libX11-devel libpng-devel mesa-libGL-devel qca2-devel exiv2-devel lcms-devel libxslt-devel libgsf-devel poppler-qt-devel libphonon-devel libeigen2-devel libqtopengl-devel boost-devel libqtwebkit-devel

=================================================
intel code:

cmake options:
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

Install the following packages:
  qt-mobility-devel

Optionally install kdebase-runtime, which is needed for the oxygen icons (not currently available in any form in the intel tablet ux repositories, this will need fixing)
